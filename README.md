# Meditate

Meditate is a prototype listing app which supports **multitasking**. The app gets benefits of size classes as well.

## Components

- A list with multiple type of elements, both horizontal and vertical.
- A detail screen that is navigated by pressing any content but banner.


## What I used and why?

>- ```Alamofire``` : To avoid complication while doing this little project, as Antoine van der Lee specified on [his blog post](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/alamofire-vs-urlsession/), I preferred using Alamofire.

>- ```Kingfisher``` : I also used Kingfisher for image network requests and caching. Kingfisher is doing really good job when it comes to deal with multiple images as I've exprerienced before.
